Description: Functions for calculating (1) shade height at a single point, (2) shaded proportion of a building facade; (3) a polygonal layer of shade footprints on the ground; and (4) Sky View Factor (SVF) value at a single point. Typical inputs include a polygonal layer of buildings outline along with the height of each building, sun azimuth and sun elevation. The package also provides functions for related preliminary calculations: converting polygons to line segments, finding segment azimuth, shifting segments by azimuth and distance, and constructing the footprint of a line of sight between an observer and the sun.
